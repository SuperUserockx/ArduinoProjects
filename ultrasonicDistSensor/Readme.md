# Ultrasonic Distance sensor

This project was a part of class 12 final project for physics and computer science.

The project reads the data from HC-05 sensor and calculated the distance ion centimeters and even converts them to inches.

After the data is calculated it is displayed on to LCD connected to the arduino and then even firing an alarm whenever the obstruction was to close to the sensor.
